### Construct some Lego Minifigure Classes and make them do stuff

**Properties**

Hair/Hat, Head, Torso, Legs, Accessories, etc.

**Methods**

If you were working at [Tt Games](http://www.ttgames.com/), your minifigure classes might have actions associated with them in the form of jump, double jump, attack, special attack, look & move methods.

There might even be certain conditions that must be met to construct (or unlock) a new character or other kind of object.

- You don't actually need to write any functionality in these methods
right away. If you just want to "stub out" a method, but you still want
to see if your code compiles, you can insert this line into your method
body in lieu of functionality like Console.WriteLine.

    ```csharp
    throw new NotImplementedException();
    ```
